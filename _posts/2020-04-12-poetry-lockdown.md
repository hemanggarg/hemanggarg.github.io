On the earth
Coronavirus took birth.

Now we're in our home,
With nowhere to roam.

Because its a lockdown,
Waiting for it to shutdown.

In our home getting bored,
Can't even see Ferrari vs Ford.

When coronavirus gets killed,
We will no longer be medically billed.

Hard to spend our time,
Watching Amazon Prime.

Watching it for hours,
Scared of the problem going too far.

That it would happen all life,
Gets more serious and all the like.

The person who spread the corona,
Will need to apologize.

```
